        1. Coffee has been around since 800 A.D.
       </h3>
       <p2>
        According to legend, 9th-century goat herders discovered how caffeine affected their goats,
        who looked like they were "dancing" (probably high on caffeine) after eating the Coffea plant's fruit.
        After that discovery, the cup of coffee as we know it was born when a local monk made a drink with
        the product and discovered that it kept him awake all night.

       </h3>

       </h3>

        of the most sought-after types of coffee, called Kopi luwak
        - also known as “cat poop coffee”. The coffee is made from
        coffee cherries that have been eaten, digested, and then pooped out by the mammal.
        The beans are then cleaned and processed. With prices ranging between $35 and $100 a cup,
        or about $100 to $600 a pound, this coffee is known as the world's most expensive coffee.

        " Pope Clement VII, on the other hand, was so fond of coffee that he abolished the ban and had it baptized in the year 1600.
        For its alleged links to rebellious sentiment, the Swedish government made both coffee and coffee paraphernalia
        (including cups and dishes) illegal as recently as the 18th century
